I recently completed my Masters in Language Technologies from CMU where I was advised by [Jaime Carbonell](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jgc "Jaime Carbonell") and [Alan Black](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb "Alan Black"). I will be starting as a Machine Learning Engineer with Apple Input and Intelligence team that provides a suite of latest NLP technologies for iOS developers. 
In am quite fascinated by sciences that enable machines to navigate the complexities of our world especially language.    
Over the past two years I have worked on NLP projects in Machine Translation, Code-Switching and Dialogue Systems. 
I am also interested in some of the issues with current machine learning models e.g. model interpretability, catastrophic forgetting and inducing the notion of causality within the learning process.

Please visit the projects tab for more details.
