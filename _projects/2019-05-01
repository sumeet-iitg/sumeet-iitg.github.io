Replaying examples from previous tasks is a popular way to overcome catastrophic forgetting in machine learning systems
aimed at continual learning (CL). Effectively selecting these examples to honor memory and time constraints however, is a 
challenging problem. We exeprimented several prin-cipled approaches for fixed-memory replay sampling derived from
`Influence' functions (Cook & Weisberg, 1982) to select useful examples that could help overcome catastrophic forgetting 
on previously encountered  tasks. We  performed  an in-depth study of the effectiveness of influence-based sampling on the 
Split-MNIST benchmark dataset in three different continual learning settings and compare with other competitive subset sampling techniques.  
We empirically evaluated Herding, K-means and Influence function-based sampling as effective replay sampling strategies across different CL settings.
